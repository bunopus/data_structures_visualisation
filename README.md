# Dart Workshop Lafore 

WORK IN PROGRESS

## What is that?
This is a realization workshops from [Data Structures & Algorithms in Java by LaFore](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-Edition/dp/0672324539)

Because this book using `applets`, which deprecated, for workshops it's not useful. So I decided to rewrite all workshops to work in the browser.

## Additional information
A web app that uses [AngularDart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular) and
[AngularDart Components](https://webdev.dartlang.org/components).
