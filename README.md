# Data structures visualisation

WORK IN PROGRESS

## What is that?
This is a realization workshops from [Data Structures & Algorithms in Java by LaFore](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-Edition/dp/0672324539)

Because this book using `java applets`, which deprecated, and not be able to work in browser. So I decided to rewrite all workshops so that they could work in the browser.
