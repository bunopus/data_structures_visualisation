# Dart Workshop Lafore

## What is that?
This is a realization workshops from [Data Structures & Algorithms in Java by LaFore](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-Edition/dp/0672324539)

Because this book using `applets`, which deprecated, for workshops it's not useful. So I decided to write all workshops so that worked in the browser.
